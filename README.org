* Implementation of typical numeric methods in =C++=

  This repository is meant only for academic purpose. It shows my
  implementations of some typical numeric methods in =C++=, that I wrote while
  learning the language. These are the methods that I have implemented so far:

  - *Root finding algorithms for 1D real functions* ::

    + *Bisection method* -- implemented in =01-root-finding/bisection.cpp= file.
    + *Iterative method* -- implementated in =01-root-finding/iterative.cpp=
      file. The implementation is very basic and it does not check any kind of
      convergence of the g(x) = x function at the guess values of x.
